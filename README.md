## TASKS

1. Install [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) package as dependency - you can find instruction on website or in presentation.
2. Install [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) as dev dependency package.
3. Create new script in package.json to run prettier for every js file in project so you run something like `npm run prettier` and it run fix on your all files in project. (look at examples in prettier link)
4. Do all tasks in `task-read.js` and `task-axios.js`
5. Task `task-bonus.js` is a bonus task for extra point. 

## Example

Example is in `test-dep.js` and whole function is in `utils/axiosUtils.js`. You can try run `node test-dep.js` if you installed axios correctly or not. Also if you run `npm test`, it should validate, if you installed all dependencies. Try it!
